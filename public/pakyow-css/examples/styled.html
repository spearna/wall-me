    <h1>This is a big header.</h1>
    
    <p>
      Like you, I used to think the world was this great place where everybody lived by the same standards I did, 
      then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his world, a world where chaos rules not order, a world 
      where righteousness is not rewarded. That's Cesar's world, and if you're not willing to play by his rules, 
      then you're gonna have to pay the price.

    <h2>This is a sorta big header.</h2>

      The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the 
      island. Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. The animals can't 
      manufacture the amino acid lysine. Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll slip 
      into a coma and die.

      You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the 
      world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't 
      know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only 
      five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that 
      killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

      You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time travel. And when we get back, we gonna tell 
      everyone. How it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But then why fifty years in the future 
      when the spacecraft encounters a black hole does the computer call it an 'unknown entry event'? Why don't 
      they know? If they don't know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never told anyone it means we 
      never made it back. Hence we die down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.
