# A mutable wraps a data model and defines two things:
#
#  1.) Actions that can occur on the model that cause state mutations.
#  2.) Queries that define how particular data is to be fetched.
#
# We can also change data through the mutable:
#
#  data(:user).create(params[:user])
#  Mutables are the first step in making the route declarative (what) rather
#  than imperative (how). All of the how is wrapped up in the mutable itself,
#  letting us express only what should happen from the route.
#
#  This is important.
