A web-based chat app written using PakyowUI. PakyowUI brings live updating views
to Pakyow apps without moving logic to the client. Instead, PakyowUI apps are
written in a traditional backend-driven style. *No JavaScript was required to
build this example app (beyond the pakyow.js library bundled with PakyowUI).*

Turn off JavaScript support in your browser and the app still retains its core 
functionality (without the live updates of course). You get this progressive 
enhancement for free, without thinking about it during development.

Full documentation will be available soon, along with an official release!

# Getting Started

Make sure you have a reasonably recent version of Ruby installed (> 2.0), along 
with RubyGems and Bundler. Then, install the dependencies:

		bundle install

Next, start the app server:

		bundle exec pakyow s

You'll find the app running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!
